## Using Fetch on API's

## What I learned
- When using an eventListener on a form (with a button), code the eventListener it as a submit on the form rather than a click on the button.

## Credits
- [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com)

## Feedback for Scrimba
- I suspect they started with an h3 tag for styling purposes. Their normalize.css file uses 1rem for headings h3-h6.
- Not real pleased with the normalize.css file Scrimba uses. It genrates errors in my browser developer tools.
- With sooooo much information out there, I find it much more time efficient to watch the lesson all the way through first in order to see what the instructor expects. Then I use the Internet to code, from scratch, my solution. This gives me a more focused approach and lessons the amount of time I spend chasing rabbit trails.

Happy Coding!
