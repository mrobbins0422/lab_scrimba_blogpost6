## Using Fetch on API's

## What I learned
- Using fetch to retrieve data from an API.
- When using an eventListener on a form (with a button), code the eventListener as a submit on the form rather than a click on the button. It is more semantically correct.
- Learned how to clear a form after the data has been submitted.

## Further study
- Want to experiment more with APIs and set up one of my own.  

## Credits
- [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com)

## Feedback for Scrimba
- I suspect they started with an h3 tag for styling purposes. Their normalize.css file uses 1rem for headings h3-h6. As I strive to code semantically correct, I am becoming more aware of improper use of basic tags.
- Not real pleased with the normalize.css file Scrimba uses. It genrates errors in my browser developer tools.
- With sooooo much information out there, I find it much more time efficient to watch the lesson all the way through first in order to see what the instructor expects. Then I go back to the start of the lesson and use the Internet to code, from scratch, my solution. This gives me a more focused approach and lessons the amount of time I spend chasing rabbit trails. Also several times the lesson has shown the older, longer, and/or  more complicated way of doing things before showing the best way to code the solution.

Happy Coding!
